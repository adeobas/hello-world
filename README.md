I started learning TSQL with a Microsoft Certified Instructor back in October of 2019. While job searching and quarantining from the pandemic, I am designing own projects and visualizations to build my portfolio. 


This batch of TSQL code is based off Microsoft SQL Server’s 2017 Adventure Works database. For those of you not familiar with the Adventure Works database, it supports a fictitious, multinational manufacturing company called Adventure Works Cycles. It is a Microsoft product sample for an online transaction processing (OLTP) database. 


I’m particularly excited about this project because I got to practice my UNIONS and JOINS and really dig into how I needed to structure my queries to get the results that I desired from the database records. My main goals are as follows: 


  1.	Determine Adventure Works overall profitability and what percentage of it is derived from Reseller vs. Internet Sales.

  2.	Discover trends and pattens in customer demographics.  

  3.	Suggest a course of action to increase profitability based on my customer and product segmentation analysis. 


It is a work in progress, but I would love to hear your constructive and actionable feedback on what I could add or improve. Thank you!
